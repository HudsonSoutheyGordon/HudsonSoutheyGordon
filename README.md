### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hudson - but most people know me as Bubba (Call me whichever you prefer!)

I'm an aspiring full-stack dev currently getting a second bachelor's degree from Oregon State University in Computer Science.
My first degree was in Film & Television at UCLA.

I also own and run a small charity-forward game development studio called [Give Grow Games](givegrow.games)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an accessibility tool to help severely motor-impaired people to type, and my company's next game.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m passionate about how software can help bridge critical equity gaps improve the lives of many; that's what led to the creation of Give Grow Games. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Unity and C#! I'm always happy to help those new to either one!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸŽ¸ Fun fact: I can name any pre-2014 Taylor Swift song from the opening guitar rift.
